# The network must be "tcp", "tcp4", "tcp6", "unix" or "unixpacket".
#
# For TCP networks, if the host in the address parameter is empty or a
# literal unspecified IP address, dmarcator listens on all available
# unicast and anycast IP addresses of the local system. To only use IPv4,
# use network "tcp4". The address can use a host name, but this is not
# recommended, because it will create a listener for at most one of the
# host's IP addresses. If the port in the address parameter is empty or
# "0", as in "127.0.0.1:" or "[::1]:0", a port number is automatically
# chosen.
